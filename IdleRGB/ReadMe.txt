This application has only been tested with Corsair K70 and Corsair Scimitar.
It should in theory work with other keyboards or mouses supported by the CUE SDK.
Colors can be changed in "IdleRGB.exe.config".
Time before idle can be in settings or in "IdleRGB.exe.config".
Corsair CUE needs to be running with SDK enabled.
