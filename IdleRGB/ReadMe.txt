IdleRGB

Changes LEDs on Corsair keyboard, mouse, headset, and mousemat.
Turns off all LEDs (or to a specified color) after a specified time of no activity from keyboard and mouse.
If the keyboard has media LEDs they will change to a specified color.
All the LEDs will also change to a specified color when Caps Lock is activated.
Colors and idle time can be changed in config file.
Idle time can also be changed by right clicking tray icon.

This application has ONLY been tested with the Corsair K70 RGB and the Corsair Scimitar.
It should however work with any of the Corsair periferals supported by the CUE SDK. Corsair CUE needs to be running with the SDK option enabled.
